	<Message id="ALPHA WORK1">您的设计现在已升级为实现。

实施阶段分为三个阶段：

1. "Alpha", 开发人员和艺术家根据设计规范和要求创作产品。

2. "Delay", 取决于员工的能力，alpha期间可能会出现意外问题，在继续工作之前需要解决这些问题。

3. "Beta", 你的程序员发现了一些bug，希望在最终版本发布之前修复。</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK2">根据您的软件是否包含任何代码或艺术品，您将看到“代码”和“艺术品”单位增加。 这些信息大致告诉您要完成的工作量，数值越高，产品完成越接近。
		
这些数字并不能说明代码和艺术的实际质量。 要了解员工的工作状况，您需要进行同行评审，首先要按下“评审”按钮，然后选择“团队”。</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK3">您的产品收到一些评论后，请按结束按钮以查看结果。 请注意，审核是基于您开始审核时的产品进行的，因此在此期间所做的任何工作均不会计入。</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK4">最终得分将高于或低于实际质量，具体取决于审核者。 开发该软件的团队可能会说它比实际要好。

您可以滚动查看评论以查看评论者如何对软件的不同方面进行评分。 美术和代码的质量可能会根据您的员工的技能而随着开发而变化，而不取决于已完成的工作量。</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK5">确保在开发过程中也进行新闻发布。

在开发过程中，您还可以选择发送新闻报道版本，以便新闻记者可以试用您的软件。 新闻发布不需要您做任何工作，但是在发送之前，请确保您在同行评审和一些关注者中拥有良好的评价。</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK6">准备就绪后，按“升级”按钮进入延迟阶段，项目将自动进入beta阶段。</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK7">从理论上讲，测试阶段是无止境的，但是您必须在某个时候发布项目，尤其是如果您已经宣布发布日期。

修复尽可能多的错误是个好主意，因为有缺陷的产品会导致退款，但并非旨在修复产品中的所有可能的错误。 产品发布后，随着客户与支持团队联系，您将能够修复更多的错误。</Message>
	<Message id="ALPHA WORK8">准备好后，按发布按钮。
		
发布产品时，您必须购买或打印该产品的实体副本才能出售。 稍后，在线软件分发将变得更加流行，但是在90年代之前和90年代期间拥有产品的物理副本非常重要。
		
您既可以自己打印实物副本，也可以定购一些，价格更高。 每当您发布产品时，游戏都会提醒您这一点。</Message>
	<Message id="BENEFIT1">首先打开福利窗口</Message>
	<Message id="BENEFIT2">员工福利将被动地提高所有员工的员工满意度，如果您想降低他们的薪水或确保他们不感到无聊就辞职，这将非常有帮助。

一些员工福利可能会立即产生巨大的财务影响，而另一些福利可能会导致满意度的大幅提高而不会产生任何直接后果。

您可以放心地使用滑块并查看其影响，因为在您单击“应用”之前更改不会生效。

按继续以继续本教程。</Message>
	<Message id="BENEFIT3">如果您选中一项福利旁边的复选框并点击“应用”，则任何具有自定义福利的员工都将其重置为公司默认值。
		
您可以在员工概览窗口中单独更改员工福利。 现在尝试打开它，选择一个或多个员工，然后单击“更改福利”。</Message>
	<Message id="BENEFIT4">要为单个员工覆盖公司福利，您需要选中福利旁边的复选框。</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE1">通过单击“构建”按钮进入“构建模式”开始。</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE2">游戏始终在构建模式下暂停。

让我们从建立一个房间开始。 您要如何构建房间有两种选择。

单击构建面板中的“矩形房间”按钮以构建一个简单的矩形房间，或单击“自由角度的房间”按钮以您想要的任何形状来构建房间，一次只能建一堵墙。

您还可以使用“自由角度房间”选项，只需在现有房间中建造一堵墙，即可将房间分成两个单独的房间。</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE3">现在，在您拥有的区域（具有网格）中的某个位置单击，然后在其他位置单击以完成新房间。 移动光标时，请留意成本。</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE4">您可能已经注意到，建造房间时仅限于网格。 您可以根据需要通过将栅格小控件移动到墙壁或家具上来更改栅格和建筑角度。 例如，如果您想沿对角墙构建桌子，这可能会派上用场。

如果您不喜欢房间的外观，可以使用撤消按钮或{KeyBind:Undo}撤消更改。

准备好后，请单击继续。</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE5">您可以通过按{KeyBind:FloorUp}和{KeyBind:FloorDown}上下移动地板。

现在让我们添加门窗。 您可以选择一个类别，也可以在构建面板中搜索“窗口”或“门”。</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE6">请注意，在添加窗口时，房间是如何点亮的，请确保添加足够的空间，以便员工可以看到。

您可以通过单击并选择房间来检查照明，环境，温度和噪声状况。</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE7">您还可以更改房间和家具的颜色。

尝试通过在房间上按{KeyBind:ContextMenu}来更改房间的颜色，然后单击类似于画笔的“房间颜色”按钮。</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE8">在打开颜色窗口之前，可以通过按{KeyBind:MultipleSelect}或{KeyBind:SweepSelect}并选择对象来一次更改多个事物的颜色。 颜色窗口将提示当前正在使用的颜色。

如果您喜欢给房间的样式，则可以使用上下文菜单进行保存。

准备好后，请单击“应用”；如果要取消更改，请关闭窗口。</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE9">让我们在新房间里放些家具。

通过单击“布置”按钮或搜索“桌子”来构建新桌子。</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE10">现在添加椅子。 椅子只能添加到桌子上。

Note that some furniture, like chairs and tables, can be replaced with alternate versions after they have been placed. You can use the context menu to easily replace a lot of furniture at once, by selecting all furniture of the same type in the selected rooms for example.</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE11">Finally add a computer. When you add a computer click and hold where you want to add it and drag the mouse in the direction you want it to face, finally, release the mouse button to place it.

Computers have to sit on top of a table and face a chair.</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE12">When you put tables next to each other they will be grouped together if they don't have anything on top of them. Tables that are grouped together can be used for meetings. To see which tables are grouped, just select one table and its group will be highlighted in blue.

It's important you control the noise levels in your working environment, try enabling the audio overlay to see what furniture is making noise.</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE13">Your founder does not get tired, hungry, cold, lonely, stressed, need bathroom breaks or get annoyed in general, but when you hire new employees they will. So make sure to add at least one vending machine, a coffee machine, a radiator, a ventilator and a separate bathroom before you hire new employees.

Toggle the audio overlay to advance.</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE14">Now, let's assign the room to a team, employees from other teams may then not use it or even pass through it.

Right click your new room and choose "Switch team", which resembles a circle with arrows. A window will appear, click on "Core" to assign the room to the Core team.</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE15">Remember to assign employees to a team as well. You can do this either by pressing {KeyBind:ContextMenu} on an employee and choosing "Switch team", from the employees window or directly in the hiring window.

Pressing {KeyBind:MultipleSelect} with the mouse cursor on objects, rooms or employees will allow you to select several at once, you can then press {KeyBind:ContextMenu} anywhere to see the context menu. You can hold {KeyBind:SweepSelect} down to select objects of the same type quickly.

Try selecting at least 2 things in the game.</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE16">You can merge rooms by using the "Destroy wall" tool, or by pressing {KeyBind:MultipleSelect} to select the rooms you want to merge, press {KeyBind:ContextMenu} and then choose the "Merge rooms" option from the context menu.

Click Continue when you are ready to continue.</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE18">When you no longer feel like you have enough space for your buildings, you can buy new plot areas by going to plot mode.

When you are ready to continue, exit build mode.</Message>
	<Message id="BUILD MODE17">When you are ready, open the employees window to start managing your employees.</Message>
	<Message id="CONTRACTS1">Start by opening the contract window.</Message>
	<Message id="CONTRACTS2">This is a list of available contracts. New contracts will be added as older ones are completed.

Contracts have an upfront payment you will receive for accepting the work, and a bigger payment for completing it. You complete a contract by delivering the code and art units requested.

Try selecting a contract in the list now.</Message>
	<Message id="CONTRACTS3">The final payout will be subtracted from, for not completing the contract, for not completing it on time and for any unfixed bugs.

Not living up to the clients quality expectations will impact your business reputation, but not your payout.

Browse the contracts now and accept one that requires some code units.</Message>
	<Message id="CONTRACTS4">Until an employee actually starts working on the contract, the deadline will not count down.

During the design phase, your employees will reduce bugs in the final delivery and increase quality. Make sure you Promote your design as soon as the progress bar reaches the end, to avoid over engineering.

The tutorial will continue once you decide to move to the next phase.</Message>
	<Message id="CONTRACTS5">When code and art units (if any) reaches the client's target value, you have completed the contract, you can continue working on it if you want to deliver a better product and receive more business reputation.

Make sure you do a client review before you move on to the bug fixing stage, to make sure it lives up to their quality expectations.

The tutorial will continue once you start a review.</Message>
	<Message id="CONTRACTS6">When you are ready, move on to the bug fixing stage.

It's impossible to know exactly how many bugs a piece of software has, so just try to fix as many as you can before time runs out.

Finish your contract work to end the tutorial.</Message>
	<Message id="MAP EDITOR1">This tutorial assumes you've already tried build mode and will focus on how the map editor differs.
		
Click Continue if you're ready to advance.</Message>
	<Message id="MAP EDITOR2">The map editor gives you the ability to make a building that you'll be able to lease into when you relocate or make a new company. The map editor does not have the ability to edit normal "for sale" buildings.

In the map editor, you have an unlimited supply of money and the ability to place environment objects. Try opening the environment tab now.</Message>
	<Message id="MAP EDITOR3">You can hover over the different types of environment objects to get more details.

Another important aspect of rentable buildings is that you can provide some amenities for the tenant and you have to provide heating and cooling.
Make sure you place enough heating and cooling for the entire building. The tenant will not be able to interact with any furniture you place in the map editor.

Try building a room now.</Message>
	<Message id="MAP EDITOR4">When you select your room and open the context menu, you'll notice a couple of new options, namely the ability to group rooms, mark them for renting and mark them as player owned rooms.

When you group rooms together, they can only be leased as one single unit. Cloning rooms will carry over the same grouping style, so you can build a layout and quickly duplicate it.

There is a data overlay which allows you to see how rooms have been marked. Enable it now to end the tutorial.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION1">Welcome to the customization screen. Press "Continue" to advance the tutorial or "Cancel" to exit.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION2">Begin by picking a name for your company.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION3">Then pick a name for your founder in the game.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION4">And a gender.

You can toggle genders multiple times to randomize your founder's look.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION5">You can use these buttons to choose an aspect of your founder's appearance that you want to change.
	
You can change the shape of the face and eyebrows by clicking the first button, and the last button allows you to pick the colors of the skin, hair, accessories and clothes of your founder.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION7">Here you can pick your founder's personality traits.

You can choose two traits, which will affect your founder's behavior, listed below, and inter-office relationships.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION8">Here you can pick your founder's skill points and specializations, which will affect the performance of your founder.

Specializations are limited by skill, so if your founder has low design skill, he/she will also be low skilled in the design specialization you pick.

You can further educate and train your founder to gain skill and specializations in the game.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION9">You are now done customizing your founder. Let's begin choosing the rules of the game!</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION10">You can enable any mods here, which will be bound to the game forever.

You won't be able to enable or disable mods after your game has started, as they fundamentally alter how the game is played, but you can share your save game with others, without having to install the mods again.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION11">Pick how much money you want to start with. You start with {StartingFunds} by default, any additional funds will be taken as loans.

Note that you need at least {StartingPlot}, if you would rather purchase a plot than lease.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION12">You can change what year you want to start in here.
		
Starting later will give you the full power of modern tech and digital distribution, but your competitors will be more established.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION13">Difficulty can be changed at any point in the game by going to the options menu.

Difficulty controls how easy it is to break into the market.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION14">You can pick how many days you want per month.

1 month lasts for 1 day by default. The game was made with this pace in mind and it is therefore the recommended setting.

If you feel the game is going too fast or you want a couple of days to earn money between having to pay bills, you can increase this setting. Be aware that everything will move slower to match the setting you pick and you can't change it later on.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION15">Click the Pick map button to pick your starting environment</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION16">Here you can see a list of buildings you can buy outright or lease your way into. Next to each picture you can see whether a building is "For rent" or "For sale".

Note that the "Building area" for buildings you can lease into defines the maximum area you can lease as you expand your company.</Message>
	<Message id="CUSTOMIZATION17">You can use these buttons to pick whether you want to lease or buy an empty plot.

Construction is very expensive, so it is recommended that you start off leasing. You can relocate your company any time you want during gameplay.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT1">Start the tutorial by pressing the "Develop software" button to bring up the design document.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT2">Welcome to the design document, the heart of Software Inc.

Start by picking a software type.

Click continue to to advance the tutorial.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT3">If applicable, you can pick a software category. Each category for a software type has different development times, popularity, audience retention, features and its own target audience.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT4">Then pick a name. You can either write one yourself or press the "Name:" button to have it generated.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT5">You can also pick a price. If you leave the price field alone, the best price will be picked based on the software and features you've chosen. You can click the Price button to reset the price.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT6">Now you must pick features for your product. Each feature takes time to develop and balances innovation, stability and usability, so pick carefully.

The features you can pick depend on which software dependencies and operating systems you chose, and vice versa, when you select a feature, all dependencies and operating systems you can pick will be filtered accordingly.

Some features are artistic in nature and you will need artists on the team to get the best result.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT7">You can use these buttons to quickly select features. Note that it might not always be best to just select all features.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT8">Your product can depend on other software types. As an example, you will need a visual tool, like an image editor, to make a game with 2D graphics or you won't be able to make the graphics for it.

The features you pick will determine what type of software you need to develop your product and the quality of the dependencies will affect the quality of your product.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT9">Pick a software you want to use from the list by selecting it and pressing "OK".

You can filter software by features, the features you can pick for your software will sometimes depend on the features of the software you pick here.

Take special note of quality and license costs. Your software's quality will depend on the quality of the software you pick and you will have to pay the license fees.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT10">Some software runs on an operating system and some software can only run on operating systems that the software it is built on can run on, e.g. Games can only run on the operating systems that its Game Engine can run on. And as before, your features might also depend on which operating systems you choose to support.

You can pick your operating systems here. If nothing is shown, the software type you picked is not operating system dependent.

Press "Continue" to carry on.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT11">You can make your software a sequel to a product you made previously or which you have bought from another company. You do this by clicking this button and selecting a product as you did with operating systems and software needs.

Making a sequel will give a marketing boost and change your fans' expectations depending on the success of its predecessors.

Features that were implemented for the predecessor will be highlighted in orange in the feature panel, these features will be developed faster when you develop your product.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT12">You can also make your software in-house, which means you won't sell it to other companies.

You can use this to develop top quality game engines and only use them for your own games, to gain an advantage over other companies.

If this is not visible, it means the software you picked is meant for an audience and it wouldn't make sense to keep it in-house.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT13">If your software depends on server functionality, like an MMO, you will need to pick a server from this list.

If your servers cannot handle the load this software will generate, they will quickly burn out and you will lose your reputation.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT14">Finally, you can pick a source control server from this list to support the development.

Using source control will decrease bugs and speed up development, if your server can handle the load.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT15">After you've went through the phases of development and you're ready to release your product, remember to see if any popular products have just been released in the same software category as yours.

You can also check out upcoming releases from your competitors to make sure a large company won't outshine your product.

Timing is everything when you're just starting out!</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT16">Before you finish, make sure you inspect the information in this box. This outlines everything you need to develop this product.

Take special note of consumer reach. Consumer reach is how many people can potentially purchase the product as of right now, this number might decrease or increase as you develop the product. For software that depend on operating systems, it will be limited by how many people are currently using the operating system and it's successors.

Having more than the suggested amount of employees on the development teams will result in diminishing returns, so you're paying more in salaries, but getting a smaller and smaller speed increase in return.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN DOCUMENT17">Click the develop button when you're ready to begin development.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN WORK1">To start developing your software, designers need to piece together a document, which describes how the software should be developed and structured, to make sure everyone is on the same page.
	
Design work items are worked on by designers or employees in "Any role" until you promote the work item to alpha. Good design documents will make it easier for programmers to write good quality code and reduce the amount of bugs in the final product.

Press "continue" to advance the tutorial.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN WORK3">The work item will slowly fill up as it progresses. For design documents it is important to stop when the task is completely green, so you don't lose quality. If you wait too long, inexperienced designers will begin over-engineering.
		
While you wait, you should start telling the world about your new software. Start by announcing a release date by pressing the Market button.

You'll have to do some guess work when picking a release date, but it will increase the effectiveness of all your future marketing efforts with your product. Just make sure you release it on time!</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN WORK4">Before you move on to development you should make a press release to tell the world about your product.
		
When you market your product before it's released you build a following, who will buy your product when it releases. Your followers might not all buy it straight away or might refund it, so they are not guaranteed sales.

Your employees will have to work on making the press release, so if you think it'll take a while, you can pause your design work by pressing the play button, to avoid over-engineering.

Start by bringing up the marketing window again.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN WORK5">Make sure you read the text in the marketing window, as it tells you how to handle the different marketing actions available to you.</Message>
	<Message id="DESIGN WORK6">Click the Develop button to begin development when you are ready.

Right click the title bar of the work item to toggle between normal and collapsed view.

Left click the title bar and drag to re-arrange your work items.</Message>
	<Message id="DIGITALDISTRIBUTION1">Open the distribution window to begin the tutorial.</Message>
	<Message id="DIGITALDISTRIBUTION2">To start selling products through your own digital online store, you can click the highlighted button in the distribution window and pick a server to run the store on. Note that running your own store requires a lot of bandwidth if a product is selling well.

You need to set up deals with other companies individually if you want them to sell their products through your store.

Open up the companies window now, to see how to make distribution deals.</Message>
	<Message id="DIGITALDISTRIBUTION3">Click on the details button on a company you want to make a deal with, to open the company's detail window.

The window will have a button to start negotiating a distribution deal, if applicable.

To continue, make sure you have opened a digital distribution store and click the highlighted deal button. Otherwise, you can come back to this tutorial later through the Options window.</Message>
	<Message id="DIGITALDISTRIBUTION4">Here you can see all previous bids and you can use the slider and button to make new offers.
		
You have the ability to Cancel the deal before your first bid. Once the bidding war has started, the deal will either succeed or fail.

If a deal fails, your relationship with the other company will temporarily degrade. You need to wait some months after a failed deal, if you want to get a good deal.

Your digital market share and the other company's worth will influence how much they are willing to give you and some companies drive a harder bargain than others.</Message>
	<Message id="EDUCATION1">Begin the tutorial by selecting one or more of your employees, right click anywhere on the screen to bring up the action menu, and then pick "Educate employee".</Message>
	<Message id="EDUCATION2">This is the education window.

You can send employees for education to increase their specialization skills, beyond what is possible from work experience, or you can train your leaders in HR management.

Note that employee base skills can't be increased through education, but only experience. If you want an employees base skill to improve faster, make them work with higher skilled employees on tasks which require that skill.</Message>
	<Message id="EDUCATION3">Start by choosing the amount of months to educate your employees. Note that educational courses are considered paid leave, so you will also be paying salaries on top of course expenses.</Message>
	<Message id="EDUCATION4">Then pick what role you want to educate your employees in.</Message>
	<Message id="EDUCATION5">Unless you picked HR management, you should also pick what specialization you want them to improve in. Click "Start education" when you are ready to send your employee off.</Message>
	<Message id="EMPLOYEES1">Begin by opening the employee window.</Message>
	<Message id="EMPLOYEES2">This is a list of all your employees, which details their status.

You can check any of the options in the top bar to get more details on all your employees.</Message>
	<Message id="EMPLOYEES3">When you select an employee in the list, they will be selected in the game and you can get details on their specializations at the bottom of the window.

Try selecting an employee now.</Message>
	<Message id="EMPLOYEES4">You can select several employees by holding down shift or ctrl while clicking on their names in the employee window.

Now, press {KeyBind:ContextMenu} anywhere to bring up the context menu for the selected employee. Click the "Switch team" button to inspect possible team assignments.</Message>
	<Message id="EMPLOYEES5">When you are done, click "OK" and then press {KeyBind:ContextMenu} again and click the "Change employee role" button instead, which resembles a wrench.</Message>
	<Message id="EMPLOYEES6">Clicking on a role in the role window will assign the employee exclusively to that role immediately, whereas ticking the checkmark will allow you to pick several roles for you employee.
You can also toggle the "Any role" checkmark to check or uncheck all roles at once or click "Auto role" to assign the employee to the roles that the employee is most proficient at.

Note that "Leader" can't be chosen unless the employee is assigned to a team and leaders won't work in full capacity in other roles.

Close the "Select role" window and click "Continue" to advance the tutorial.</Message>
	<Message id="EMPLOYEES7">With your employee selected, press {KeyBind:ContextMenu} once again to bring up the context menu and select "Employee details", which resembles a single person.</Message>
	<Message id="EMPLOYEES8">Here you can see the stats of your employee.

In top left corner you can see your employee's personality traits, and below that, your employee's skills in each role. Clicking a role will also allow you to assign the employee to that role.</Message>
	<Message id="EMPLOYEES9">In bottom left part of the window you can see your employee's specializations, which shows how educated your employee is in different subjects.
	
The "base skill" is your employee's experience in that role.</Message>
	<Message id="EMPLOYEES10">In top right corner of the window you can see your employee's traits. These traits are controlled by your employee's two personality traits.

You can hover over each of the three traits to see how they affect the employee.</Message>
	<Message id="EMPLOYEES11">In the center right part of the window, you can see the latest thoughts of your employee, this will tell you how happy they are with their place of work, and as a consequence how effective they are at their job.

You should inspect this often to see how well an employee is doing and whether you can do anything to improve their satisfaction.</Message>
	<Message id="EMPLOYEES12">Finally, in the bottom right part of the window, you can see what is currently affecting your employee's effectiveness when working.
	
You can use this to see what is wrong if your employees suddenly start working slowly or not at all.</Message>
	<Message id="EMPLOYEES13">In the beginning of the game you will need to make some quick cash.

Bring up the Contract window to get some work.</Message>
	<Message id="HIRING1">Start by opening the hire window</Message>
	<Message id="HIRING2">Before you can hire anyone, you need to put out a search for employees. Start by choosing which role your new employee should be good at.</Message>
	<Message id="HIRING3">If you've picked a programmer, artist or designer, you should also pick a specialization you want them to be good at.</Message>
	<Message id="HIRING4">Then you need to decide how much money you want to give your potential employee per month. It is very important that you make sure you have enough money to actually pay them or you'll go bankrupt very quickly.

The quality of applicants will depend on how high you set the salary and the reputation of your company, among other things. Very high skilled employees only have a chance to appear in the highest salary bracket.</Message>
	<Message id="HIRING5">You can also choose to interview employees in specific areas upfront. You can wait to interview employees before you hire them, but that might be more expensive, depending on how many you intend to hire.

Each interview option will increase the final cost of your employee search.</Message>
	<Message id="HIRING6">Finally, you need to decide how much money you want to spend searching for applicants. The more money you spend, the more potential employees you will reach. You're guaranteed to receive at least one application.

Press "Begin looking" to begin searching.</Message>
	<Message id="HIRING8">This is a list of employees that applied to the open position in your company. You can select employees to inspect them and press the "Hire" button to hire them.

Employees are expensive and you should probably wait before you hire any if you are just starting out.

Try selecting an employee on the list.</Message>
	<Message id="HIRING9">You can easily navigate the applications by using the arrow keys on your keyboard and pressing enter to hire.

When you are done, simply close the window.</Message>

You can start a marketing campaign by opening your release window, selecting a product and clicking the market button</Message>
	<Message id="MARKETING2">This is the marketing window.
		
Marketing your product is a potentially endless money sink. The more money you use, the bigger advantage you get over competing products. Bigger software products will need more marketing to compete.

	<Message id="MARKETING3">You can set a budget, which puts an upper limit to the spending for this marketing task. "0" means there is no limit.

	<Message id="NEWPROJECTMANAGEMENT1">Start by opening the project management window.</Message>
	<Message id="NEWPROJECTMANAGEMENT2">Project management let's you delegate a release cycle to a leader in your company, so they control everything from creating a design to supporting the product once it's released.

A project management team needs a leader. The leader will dedicate all his or her time to keeping the project running, so it might be worthwhile to keep the leader in his or her own team.

Start by selecting a leader to run the project and name your team.</Message>
	<Message id="NEWPROJECTMANAGEMENT3">Now look through each of the options to control how the projects should be handled. You can hover over each label to get a detailed description.

Leader skill determines how many points can be gathered and role specific skills control how quickly they will be gathered for each category.</Message>
	<Message id="NEWPROJECTMANAGEMENT6">The bottom panel tells you which projects are currently queued and lets you cancel or take them over.

	<Message id="INSURANCE1">Start by opening the insurance window</Message>
	<Message id="INSURANCE2">You can deposit and withdraw money by using this slider.

Money on your insurance account earns you {SavingsInterest} interest per year, but if you withdraw the money within a certain timeframe all interest earned will be deducted.</Message>
	<Message id="INSURANCE5">The amount of time that has to pass before you can withdraw money depends on how much money you have deposited within the same financial year. You can see locked deposits in this panel.

When you decide to withdraw money, the bank will start by trying to withdraw any money on your savings account that won't incur an interest fee.</Message>

	<Message id="STOCKS1">In the upper right corner of the company window, you will see a list of stocks.

The first stock in the list is the company's own share, which you can buy if you have bought all other stocks in the list.

You have two options when you buy a company's main share, you can buy them out or make a subsidiary of your own company. You can only have as many subsidiaries as you have business reputation stars.

Buying out a company will give you their IP and their patents. Making them a subsidiary will allow you to control them, deposit and withdraw money from them and close them at any time.

When a company goes bankrupt, all its assets will go to the majority shareholder.</Message>
	<Message id="STOCKS2">When you own stock in another company, that company will pay dividends to you each month, which is the percentage you own in the company of their surplus for that month, divided by 24. You will also have to pay dividends to companies that own stock in your company, but it is an easy way to loan money.
		
Alternatively, you can buy the stock when it is cheap and sell it high, by trying to predict how the company will do, based on its history.

You can see which stocks a company owns in the bottom left panel.</Message>
	<Message id="STOCKS3">In the bottom middle of the window you can see the company's patents.

The detail window also gives you an overview of their planned releases and the ability to cancel them.

Press Continue when you're ready.</Message>
	<Message id="SUBSIDIARY3">Developing takes up resources for a subsidiary, if you want them to work on specific tasks, or you want to control their release schedule, you can disable their autonomy, to make sure they don't spend time doing other things.
		
You can only assign projects that the subsidiary normally develops, so pay attention to their past and future releases. Try opening the design document and picking the software type they normally work on.</Message>
	<Message id="SUBSIDIARY4">Some tasks can be assigned to subsidiaries as well. This is expensive and takes up a lot of the subsidiary's resources. Keep an eye out for the company option when you are selecting teams for a task.
		
End the tutorial when you are ready</Message>
	<Message id="SUPPORT WORK1">When you release a new piece of software it will spawn a support work item. Through this work item you will receive support tickets from your customers, assuming you have any.
		
Support tickets should be answered as quickly as possible. Employees with good programming skills will be able to verify specific bugs quickly as tickets are answered, which your employees will then proceed to fix.

Support for a product never ends by itself, so you'll have to end it when you don't think support is necessary anymore. Keep an eye on the active user count to help guide you.</Message>

	<Message id="TEAMMANAGEMENT4">The specialization slider allows you to stop employees from working with code or art they don't have that much skill in.
		
High skilled employees will have a much bigger impact on your product quality than low skilled employees. If you really want to avoid an employee dragging down the quality of your product, because they aren't skilled with 2D art for instance, you can use the specialization slider to keep them from working with that specialization.</Message>
